                    I am a recent graduate and full stack developer, with a passion for creating innovative software solutions that meet the needs of clients and users. My journey into software development started when I took a full stack development course, where I gained experience in a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
                    Since then, I have honed my skills through a variety of projects and professional experiences. As a full stack developer, I have experience working on both front-end and back-end development, and I am comfortable with a range of tools and technologies. Some of my areas of expertise include Java, Html, CSS, JavaScript, Angular JS, MySQL, as well as agile development methodologies and cloud computing.
                    In addition to my technical skills, I am also passionate about collaboration and communication. I believe that effective teamwork is essential for success in any software development project, and I work closely with my colleagues and clients to ensure that we are all aligned on goals and objectives.
                    I am excited to continue building my skills and pursuing new opportunities in the field of software development. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me via
